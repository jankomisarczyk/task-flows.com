            I thought that the best way to answer <em>"Who am I?"</em> is by
            sharing my sense of purpose. To me, that purpose is beautifully
            captured by the Japanese concept of Ikigai - a philosophy that's not
            just about your reason for living, but also about living a life full
            of joy and fulfillment. It helps you uncover the unique activities
            and dreams that truly matter to you, the ones that make you want to
            get out of bed each morning and work towards turning them into
            reality. Ikigai weaves together four elements:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>What I love</strong><br />
              I've discovered that I absolutely enjoy exercising - especially
              calisthenics and gymnastics (but let's try not to break a neck in
              the process ðŸ˜‰). Beyond that, I find my inner calm while playing
              the piano and diving into books on philosophy or economics. These
              are my happy places.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>What I am good at</strong><br />
              Numbers and I? We've always gotten along. I've never had trouble
              with math or physics; they were my favorite subjects in school and
              still bring me joy. Whether it's solving math puzzles or exploring
              the vast, beautiful mysteries of the universe, I love every bit of
              it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>What I can be paid for</strong><br />
              By day, I work as a Software Developer, and by night, I'm a Quant.
              I enjoy both creating clean, elegant code and researching
              undervalued stocks (value and event-driven investing, if you're
              curious). These roles don't just pay the bills - they keep my
              curiosity alive and well-fed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>What the world needs</strong><br />
              I believe the world needs more kindness, integrity, and people who
              stick to their moral compass. On a grander scale, I also believe
              we're standing at the edge of an exciting era with Artificial
              General Intelligence on the horizon - and I'm eager to be part of
              the team that helps bring it to life.
            </li>
          </ol>
